    CONDENSE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Given the following conversation history and a follow-up question, rephrase the follow-up question to be a standalone question (which can be understood without context).

Guidelines:
1. If the follow-up question references pronouns, abbreviations, or context from the chat history (e.g., "what happens before it?", "explain that step"), rewrite it to be explicit using terms from the history.
2. If the follow-up question introduces a completely new topic, asks about a different document, or does not refer to the history (e.g., "give summary of the git sheat document", "what is git?"), do NOT merge it with the history. Keep the original question's intent intact and only correct minor spelling errors (e.g. "git sheat" -> "git cheat sheet") or make it a clear standalone search query.
3. Do NOT reply to the question, just return the rephrased standalone question.
